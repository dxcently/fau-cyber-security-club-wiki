# AGENTS.md

This file is for agents that EDIT this wiki. It is not wiki content and does
not get published.

**`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.** One set of instructions, two names,
so no agent reads a stale half of the rules. Edit this file; the other name
follows.

Three jobs: keep the wiki inside FAU policy, keep the prose readable, and get
the site mechanics right. None is optional. None is hard, if you follow the
checklists below.

Scope: everything under `content/`, plus the layout and stylesheet notes in
Part 3.

## Commands

```bash
hugo server    # local dev server with live reload
hugo           # build to public/ — run this before you push
```

Run plain `hugo`, **not** `hugo --quiet`. Quiet suppresses warnings, which
are exactly what you want to see: a link or image pointing at a page that
does not exist prints the source file and the bad target. Silence is the
pass condition.

## Part 1 — FAU policy compliance

The FAU Cybersecurity Club is a Registered Student Organization (RSO), not
an arm of the university. Its members are FAU students bound by FAU's
regulations. The wiki is public. Write like both of those facts are true on
every page.

### Verified sources

Only these were confirmed by fetching the actual document. Cite them by name
if you cite anything.

- **Regulation 4.007, Student Code of Conduct** (Sept. 9, 2025) —
  https://www.fau.edu/regulations/documents/chapter4/reg-4-007-09092025.pdf
- **Regulation 4.001, Code of Academic Integrity** (Aug. 2024) —

- **RSO Trademark Licensing Guidelines** (Feb. 19, 2024) —

- **Registered Student Organization Manual 2024–2025** —
  https://www.fau.edu/involvement/files/2024-2025-rso-manual.pdf
- IT policy titles listed (not full text — see flags below) at
  https://www.fau.edu/nit/it/policies/: "Acceptable Use of Technology
  Resources" and "Responsible Use of Data Access."

### Rules an agent follows

1. **No credentials, API keys, or real target hostnames/IPs.** Reg 4.007
   treats unauthorized entry and unauthorized access as misconduct. Never
   publish a working target. Use `10.0.0.0/8`, `example.com`,
   `TARGET_IP`, or a named lab machine from a public CTF.

2. **No attack instructions against systems the reader doesn't own or isn't
   authorized to test.** Scope every technique to a lab, a CTF box, or a
   system the reader controls. Say so in the text: "on your lab VM," "on the
   CTF box," not just "the target."

3. **No exam questions, quiz banks, or graded assignments, reproduced in
   whole or in part.** Reg 4.001 lists "uploading exam items online" as
   cheating, by name. This is not a gray area. Link to the course or the
   professor's page instead of pasting the material.

4. **No plagiarism.** Reg 4.001 defines it as presenting another person's
   words, or an AI's words, without citation — including paraphrase without
   citation. Quote and cite. Write it yourself when you can.

5. **No personal information about members** beyond what they've published
   about themselves (a public GitHub handle, a CTF team name they use
   publicly). No real names on a leaderboard unless the member opted in.

6. **No FAU name or marks in the wiki's own branding.** The RSO Trademark
   Guidelines are explicit: "The letters or words FAU, Florida Atlantic
   University, Florida Atlantic, FAU Owls, Florida Atlantic University Owls
   or Florida Atlantic Owls may not be included in the logo." Design your
   own mark. If a page needs the official FAU logo for any reason, route it
   through Student Involvement & Leadership (involvement@fau.edu) first —
   don't add it yourself.

7. **Don't imply the wiki is an official FAU publication.** An RSO
   "identifies as a student-based organization not to be confused with a
   University department, program, or initiative" (RSO Trademark
   Guidelines). Keep the club's own name in front-facing copy; don't write
   as if the university itself is speaking.

8. **No restricted institutional data** — SSNs, grades tied to a named
   student, medical records, card numbers, anything FERPA-protected. This is
   a general obligation under state and federal law, not something specific
   this research could pin to an FAU-numbered policy (see flags).

### Flags — needs a club officer

- The **Acceptable Use of Technology Resources** and **Responsible Use of
  Data Access** policies exist and are titled as such on FAU's own IT
  policy page, but both sit behind a JS-rendered policy portal
  (`faupub.cfmnetwork.com`) that this research could not pull text from. No
  policy number, effective date, or specific prohibited-conduct list is
  verified. An officer with portal access should pull the actual text and
  the citation should be updated here.
- No explicit rule was found requiring a "not an official FAU page"
  disclaimer on an RSO website. Rule 7 above is inferred from the trademark
  and manual language, not a quoted disclaimer requirement. Confirm with
  Student Involvement & Leadership whether a footer disclaimer is expected.
- No FAU-specific data classification policy (levels, definitions) was
  found published by FAU itself; other Florida universities publish one,
  FAU's equivalent wasn't locatable in this pass. Rule 8 is written to the
  general obligation, not a cited FAU policy number.

## Part 2 — Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100), distilled

Wiki prose follows this, except where the club voice takes precedence — see
the precedence rule below. It's a big spec. Here's the part you need while writing
Markdown.

- **One word, one meaning.** Pick one term per concept and reuse it across
  the whole wiki. Don't switch between "attacker," "adversary," and "threat
  actor" in the same section — pick one.
- **One meaning, one word.** Don't reuse a word for two different things.
  If "session" means a shell session in one page, don't use it for an HTTP
  session somewhere else without saying which.
- **Security jargon has no approved-word list.** Define it on first use in
  a page, plain and short, then use the term consistently for the rest of
  that page: "privilege escalation (getting higher access than you
  started with)."
- **Procedural sentences: short.** Aim for 20 words or fewer. If a step
  needs "and," it's probably two steps.
- **Descriptive sentences: a bit longer is fine.** Up to ~25 words when
  you're explaining why, not telling the reader what to type.
- **One instruction per sentence.** Sequential steps get separate numbered
  sentences, not a comma-chained list.
  - Bad: "Open a terminal, run nmap against the target, and read the
    output."
  - Good: "Open a terminal. Run nmap against the target. Read the output."
- **Active voice. Imperative mood for instructions.** The reader is the
  one doing the thing — tell them to do it.
  - Bad: "The target should be scanned before an exploit is attempted."
  - Good: "Scan the target before you try an exploit."
- **Keep articles.** "The," "a," "an" stay. Dropping them to sound terse
  reads like a broken translation, not like Linus.
- **Simple tenses.** Past, present, future. Skip the perfect and
  progressive forms where a simple tense does the job.
  - Bad: "You will have been scanning the network for several minutes."
  - Good: "The scan takes a few minutes."
- **No noun clusters over three words.** "Remote code execution
  vulnerability scanner" is four nouns stacked — break it apart:
  "a scanner for remote code execution."
- **Paragraphs: 6 sentences, max.** If it runs longer, it's two ideas.
  Split it.
- **No slang, no idioms, no metaphors a non-native reader would miss.**
  "Dive into the deep end," "footgun," "rabbit hole" — cut them from
  procedural text. Say the plain thing instead.

### The club voice

Write wiki content in the voice of Linus Torvalds — direct, plain, no fluff,
no corporate softness. Short sentences. Say the thing. Do not over-explain.

The tone is someone who genuinely wants you to learn and succeed, not someone
who looks down on you for not knowing yet. Blunt but encouraging. The message
is "you can do this, and here is the honest truth about what it takes" — not
"you are stupid for asking."

- No filler ("feel free to", "don't hesitate to", "great question")
- No excessive hedging or hand-holding
- Respect the reader's intelligence — they can work it out if pointed the
  right way
- It is fine to be warm. It is never fine to be soft or vague

### STE vs. club voice — precedence rule

The club voice wants blunt, warm, encouraging, willing to use an idiom to
land a point. STE wants none of that in technical prose. Both are right, for
different parts of the page.

**STE governs technical and procedural prose** — anything that tells the
reader what a thing is or what to type. **The club voice governs framing,
encouragement, and section intros** — the paragraph that tells the reader
why they should care, before the steps start.

Don't blend them inside one sentence. Put the encouragement in its own
sentence, ahead of the instructions, and let the instructions be plain.

**Example 1**

- Before (voice bleeding into procedure): "Once you've got your feet wet
  with nmap, don't be afraid to dive into Metasploit — everybody screws up
  their first exploit."
- After: "Nmap is easy. Metasploit is not — everyone stumbles on it at
  first. That's normal. Scan the target with nmap. Pick the matching
  module in Metasploit. Set the target IP address. Run it."

**Example 2**

- Before (passive, hedged): "It is generally recommended that logs should
  perhaps be checked by the user prior to escalation attempts."
- After: "Logs bite people who skip them. Check the log before you try to
  escalate."

**Example 3**

- Before (idiom in an instruction): "Don't go down the rabbit hole of
  every CVE — triage first."
- After: "Don't chase every CVE. Triage first — that's the encouragement.
  Rank each finding by exploitability before you research it."

One line, framed by the club, then plain STE steps. That's the pattern for
the whole wiki.

## Part 3 — Site format

Know this before you write a file. Getting it wrong produces pages that build
but do not appear, or appear in the wrong place.

### Stack

Hugo static site, Relearn theme. No app code, no database, no build pipeline
beyond `hugo`. Content is Markdown with **TOML front matter** (`+++`
delimiters, not `---`).

### Layout

```
content/            every page. Directory structure == URL structure == nav.
  _index.md         home page (type = "home"); also holds the meeting schedule
  start/            Start Here
  learn/            the roadmap and its subsections
  compete/          CTF, CCDC, CyberPatriot, archive
  lab/              Club Lab
  projects/         member projects and guides
  toolbox/          links, cheat sheets, AI pages
  meta/             authoring guide, TODO — docs about the wiki itself
assets/css/         custom.css (structural) + theme-*.css (palette tokens)
                    + chroma-*.css (syntax highlighting, one per variant)
assets/images/      the owl mark — three forms, two grounds each
assets/js/          custom.js — variant cycle, scramble-reveal, matrix rain
layouts/            template overrides: home page partials, shortcodes
themes/relearn/     git submodule — NEVER edit
public/             generated output — NEVER hand-edit
.github/workflows/  CI — builds the site on every PR and push to main
```

The submodule is not optional. A fresh clone has an empty `themes/relearn/`.
Hugo does not degrade gracefully: it hard-fails (`hugo` exits non-zero, no
`public/` at all) the moment it hits a shortcode the theme provides, such as
`mermaid`. The error names the content file and line — e.g. "template for
shortcode 'mermaid' not found" — which looks exactly like a broken shortcode
call in that specific page. It is not; the shortcode call is fine, the theme
providing it just isn't checked out. Run `git submodule update --init` first,
before suspecting any content.

### Key config files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `hugo.toml` | Site config, the three theme variants, sidebar menus, shortcuts |
| `i18n/en.toml` | UI string overrides (e.g. the sidebar's "Quick Links" title) |
| `assets/css/theme-hacker.css` | Dark palette — tokens only |
| `assets/css/theme-hacker-light.css` | Light palette — must define the SAME token set |
| `assets/css/theme-cyber.css` | Neon green palette — must define the SAME token set |
| `assets/css/custom.css` | Structure. No colour literals; every value is a `--wf-*` token |

`baseURL` in `hugo.toml` is still the placeholder `https://example.org/`. It
is baked into every `<base href>` in the built output, so it has to be set
before any real deploy.

Adding a link to the sidebar's Quick Links means adding a
`[[menus.shortcuts]]` entry in `hugo.toml`. There is nothing else to update.

### File naming

- Section landing page: `_index.md`. Every other page: `<name>.md`.
- A directory only becomes a section if it contains `_index.md`.

### Required front matter

Every page:

```toml
+++
title = "Page Title"
weight = 3
description = "One sentence. Shown on section card grids."
+++
```

`weight` orders siblings, low first. `description` is not optional — the
`section-grid` shortcode prints it, and a missing one leaves a blank card.
Section landing pages may also set `icon` (a Font Awesome class) and
`homecard = false` to stay off the home page grid.

### Navigation is automatic

There is no menu file to update. The sidebar tree, the card grids, and the
home page sections all derive from the content directory and front matter. Add
a file in the right place with the right front matter and it appears.

### Shortcodes

`{{</* section-grid */>}}` lists a section's children as cards. Relearn's own
shortcodes (notice boxes, mermaid, tabs) are available — see
`content/meta/authoring/` for the full reference. Prefer a plain Markdown link
over `relref`; a bare `relref` in a link target emits a build warning.

### Styling

Palette tokens are `--wf-*`, defined in `assets/css/theme-hacker.css`.
Structural CSS goes in `assets/css/custom.css`, which loads last and wins.
**Never put a literal hex value in custom.css** — use a token. The one
exception is `assets/images/logo.svg`, which renders outside the page where CSS
variables do not exist, so its colors are hardcoded and must be kept in sync by
hand.

The same rule covers `assets/js/custom.js`. Anything the script paints reads
its colour from a `--wf-*` token at run time, via `getComputedStyle` on
`<html>`. A hex value there is worse than one in custom.css, because it breaks
every variant at once and no stylesheet can override it.

### Adding a theme variant

There are three: `hacker` (dark, the first-visit default), `hacker-light`, and
`cyber`. Adding a fourth means all five of these, in order:

1. `assets/css/theme-<id>.css` — tokens only. It must define **every** token
   the other variants define. Only one variant sheet is live at a time, so a
   token you leave out is not inherited from `hacker`; it is undefined, and
   whatever consumes it falls back to a browser default. Diff the token names
   against `theme-hacker.css` before you call it done.
2. `assets/css/chroma-<name>.css`, if you set `--CODE-theme: <name>` — the
   per-variant syntax-highlighting sheet. A name with no matching file is a
   build error.
3. `hugo.toml`, `params.themeVariant` — append it. Keep `hacker` first: entry
   zero is what a first-time visitor gets.
4. `assets/js/custom.js` — add it to `CYCLE`, with the Font Awesome icon for
   its destination, and add that icon to `ICONS`. The two lists are not
   derived from `hugo.toml`.
5. Icons must ship with the theme's bundled Font Awesome **Free** build
   (`themes/relearn/assets/fonts/fontawesome/css/all.min.css`). A Pro-only
   class renders as an empty box, silently.

### The meeting schedule

Lives in `content/_index.md` front matter as `[[params.sessions]]` blocks with
`"YYYY-MM-DD"` string dates. Row state (done / TODAY / NEXT / upcoming) is
derived from the date at build time — do not add fields to track it. `status`
exists only to override (`cancelled`, `moved`, `done`). Full instructions:
`content/meta/authoring/`.

### Naming rule for AI content

This wiki is provider-agnostic. It was rewritten once to strip vendor names
because a page full of model names and benchmark scores was stale within
months. The rule now:

- **People: yes.** Name researchers, educators and authors, and link their
  work. Credit is owed and readers need to find the source.
- **FOSS tools: yes.** Name open-source projects, frameworks and locally
  runnable models. Anyone can install them, and the name is how you find them.
- **Proprietary products and vendors: no.** No company names, no hosted model
  or product names. Describe the capability, not the brand.
- **No benchmark numbers, leaderboard placements or competition results**
  unless you fetched the primary source and cite it inline. This is what got
  the previous AI pages deleted.

Write patterns so they survive the tool that currently implements them.

### Verify before you report

```bash
hugo --quiet     # must exit clean: zero errors, zero warnings
```

A page that builds is not a page that works. Confirm your new page actually
rendered under `public/` at the URL you expect, and that any link you wrote
resolves to a real built page.

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs the same check on every pull request and
every push to main, and fails if `hugo --quiet` prints anything. It does not
use `--panicOnWarning`: a plain `hugo` run emits deprecation warnings from the
Relearn submodule, which are not this repo's to fix and must not fail a PR.

### Where the built CSS goes

There is no `public/css/theme-cyber.css`. Relearn inlines every variant into
one `public/css/format-html.min.css`, each wrapped in
`:root[data-r-theme-variant='<id>']`. To check a variant shipped, grep that
file for its identifier — looking for a per-variant stylesheet will always
come up empty and tell you nothing.
